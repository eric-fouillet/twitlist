# twitlist

A simple Twitter list manager.

## Introduction

The Twitter web interface doesn't allow adding/removing multiple users from a list in one go.

Lists are a good way to separate accounts by theme, so I created this small application to manage lists more easily.

The server is in Go (exposing a REST interface), the UI is in Elm. This is a workin progress.

## Installation:

Work in progress

## Dependencies

This depends on a slightly modified version of Anaconda, to add missing API calls. It is forked under my account.
